title: Understanding Positive Reinforcement
---

I find that many people misunderstand positive reinforcement. When you ask someone, "What is positive reinforcement?" Most folks describe some "positive" event or "reward" following a behavior. For example, someone might answer, "Positive reinforcement occurs when Johnny gets an A on his test and his mom says, 'Good Job!'" I want to say this is wrong, but the truth is, we don't know if "Good job!" *functioned* as a reinforcer.

I emphasized the word *functioned* because reinforcement is a *functional* description of the relationship between a behavior and a consequence that followed the behavior. Reinforcement occurs when the probability of a behavior is increased as a function of the reinforcing event (Skinner, 1957). Thus, in order to validate the answer above, we would need more information about Johnny's future behavior. Did Johnny maintain or increase the amount of A's on his tests in the future? If so, we have some evidence that "Good job!" may have functioned as a positive reinforcer*.

Another aspect of positive reinforcement that I find people misunderstanding is the fact that "positive" does not mean "good" or "desired." The positive part of positive reinforcement simply means something was added into the environment following behavior. This has nothing to do with the value or goodness of the thing (i.e., stimulus) that was added in. Thus, "Good Job!" would be "positive" in the sense that it was added into the environment following Johnny's receipt of A test scores. If Johnny's mom said, "Bad work!" this would still involve addition to the environment. Although, it is more likely that this event would function as positive punishment. :(

Stay tuned for more short (and sweet) posts about behavior!

  *Note: This evidence doesn't pass the bar of demonstrating a causal or functional relationship, but this topic is beyond the scope of this post. Nonetheless, a simple way to test whether the above example demonstrates a functional relationship is to conduct a reversal. That is, instruct Johnny's mom not to say "Good job!" after Johnny gets A's on his papers. If "Good job!" was a positive reinforcer maintaining the behavior, we would expect Johnny to get less A's on his tests. Yet another possibility is that Johnny contacted extraneous, more natural consequences for his test scores (e.g., feeling good about doing well in school, teacher praise, increase in class rank/GPA, etc.) and in this case the behavior would be irreversible. Then, we could alter our experimental design to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_baseline_design" target="_blank">multiple baseline</a> and/or group design.
